# MATslurm
Submit slurm sbatch scripts using MATLAB with versatile function parameter testing and smart binning of jobs based on walltime. Thoroughly track and concatenate model parameters and results, even if model changes. Makes the slurm setup and results concatenation agnostic to the function being tested.
